# Wireshark Part 2: FirstContact
In this lab we’ll solve one of the puzzles from the Toaster Wars high school hacking competition. The premise of the competition is that a robot has crashed in your backyard, and you need to hack into it to discover why it’s there.
For this problem, we’ve discovered that the robot is communicating wirelessly with a space ship.
We’ve captured the packets that were sent back and forth. Look through the packets for clues about the location
When you discover the location, google it.
It’s a famous place. Check your answer by calling them over and show them the name of the famous place.
