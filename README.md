# Wireshark Part 2: First Contact
In this lab, we’ll solve one of the puzzles from the Toaster Wars high school hacking competition. The background story is that a robot has crashed in your backyard, and you need to hack into it to discover why it’s there. For this problem, we’ve discovered that the robot is communicating wirelessly with a space ship and we’ve captured the packets that were sent back and forth. The captured packets are in the file [first_contact.pcap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxDZABox5hT2SDBzQ3I5QTVKVkU/edit). Your goal is to find the location of the ship by inspecting the network traffic.

1.	Click on the link [first_contact.pcap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxDZABox5hT2SDBzQ3I5QTVKVkU/edit) and download the `first_contact.pcap` file.
2.	Double click the downloaded file *or* start wireshark and choose *File | Open* to open the file you just downloaded
3. You should see something similar to the picture below

5.	Look through the packets for clues about the location. When you discover the location, [google it](http://www.google.com).
6.	It’s a famous place. If you think you found it, write down the name of the famous place and call your instructor over to check your answer.
